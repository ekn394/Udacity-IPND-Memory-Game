# Udacity-IPND-Memory-Game
This assignment was to create a 'Concentration Game' clone, using what we learned about HTML, CSS, ans JavaScript.
Dec 31, 2017.

How the game is played:
  1. Click to turn over pairs of cards.
  2. If you find a pair that match, they stay locked face up.  Otherwise they turn back face down.
  3. This continues until you have matched up all of the pairs.

What the player can expect from the game:
  - A timer begins as soon as the first card is clicked.
  - After certain threshold amounts of moves, the player's "star rating" will decrease.
  - Upon completion of the game, the player will be told how many moves they took, how long they took, and what their star rating was.
  - There is a restart button above the game board that the player can use at anytime to retry.

Resources used to develop the game:
  The game was made using SublimeText3.
